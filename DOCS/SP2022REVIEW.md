## Why we started new
Eric's Angels reviewed the previous code (located in the `sp2022` branch)
and decided we wanted to take a different approach to the design of the product.

The serverside structure is relatively similar as we also used Node.JS Express,
so we were able to reference that code. Other than that, we did not use any material
from the previous group.
