# Minimum Viable Product Direction
## Matthew O'Malley, Vincent Cortesi, Connor Thompson

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a crucial concept from the Lean Startup 
methodology that seeks to obtain the maximum amount of validated learning about 
customer behavior and preferences with the least amount of effort and resources. 
This approach is vital in new product development as it allows teams to gather 
valuable customer insights that can be used to inform decisions about the future 
direction of the product. It must be noted that although the product should be 
basic, it must still be advanced enough to help learn of its business viability.

By releasing a minimal, yet functional version of the product, teams can observe 
how customers interact with it and gather data on their behavior. This is considered
a more reliable method than simply asking customers what they would do, as it 
provides a firsthand look at actual customer behavior. The goal of an MVP is to 
validate the idea behind the product and ensure that it will be successful before 
investing time, resources, and money into a full-scale development. The MVP places 
a strong emphasis on learning and customer feedback in the development of new products
and encourages teams to pivot and make changes based on customer feedback and data.
This ensures that the product remains on track and meets the needs of its target market.

Our scrum team’s project is the Ultimate Seat Selector product. This product will be a web 
application that allows students to claim seats and teachers to view the selections.
In the case of Ultimate Seat Selector, the MVP should aim to test whether students
would use the product to log their attendance in class. Our product will need to 
have a number of features and basic requirements to deliver as an MVP. Firstly, we 
will need to have a web app that is up and running. Secondly, the application 
should be capable of the following: display a meaningful and interactive interface, 
allow a user to select a seat, load that choice into a database, and display results
in some way. The interface should have some representation of the classroom. It 
should allow users to claim seats easily and it should remember that choice. 
Ideally, it would reflect changes in real time, but wouldn’t be required for the 
MVP. Lastly, the database should have the choices organized in an understandable 
way that is consistently usable. This is the minimum level of functionality that 
this program can deliver while still being viable.

With this MVP in mind, the team behind Ultimate Seat Selector would be able to gauge
the viability of the product and make informed decisions about its future 
development. By focusing on validated learning and customer behavior, the team can 
ensure that the product remains on track and meets the needs of its target market. 
Eventually, we would like to have a selector for multiple different classrooms, a 
much cleaner-looking webpage, a “participating remotely” button, QR functionality, 
and a database to track each reporting of ‘here’ as it happens, but that is 
unnecessary for the minimum viable product. As a team, we are hoping that with an 
MVP created, determining which of these changes to implement moving forward with 
the product will be made easy. We look forward to the results!

Upon reviewing the existing product code we realized, as a team, that there was very
little to no code in production at all. We did discuss ideas surrounding the product
which were originally used. For example, the existing product contained a picture of 
the classroom. Since this idea was already put into place, it gave us a solid direction
on where we wanted to go with our product in terms of theoretically mapping out the
classroom.
