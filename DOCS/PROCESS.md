# Eric's Angels Process
We will each come to the Sprint Planning session 
with ideas for what we want to accomplish that 
sprint. We will then discuss those ideas and come
up with a plan regarding our objectives and
assinging tasks to each person. Ideally, the first
weekend of the sprint we will communicate on our progress
to be ready for the Sprint Review session the following
Tuesday.

## Schedule
Team members will be participating in a Sprint Planning 
session and a Sprint Review session on the first Tuesday
of each sprint @ 2:00 P.M.

## Continuous Improvement
