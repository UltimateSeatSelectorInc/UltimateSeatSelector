# Eric's Angel's Planning
## Sprint Planning Jan 24, 2023

For this sprint, we will be aiming to:
- Get a basic landing page hosted on Azure with Node.JS/Express.
- Research real-time options
- Build basic elements in preparation for MVP

We also discussed ideas on how to the web application will look
and how it function. Specifically, we:
- Implement ideas from concert-buying websites (boxes that represent seats)
- Potentially use image maps to allow students to claim seats
- We will have to custom-make an image of the classroom
- There are methods/tricks avaiable with our stack that allow for "real-time"
functionality.

## Sprint Review Feb 7, 2023
