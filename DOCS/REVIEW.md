## Sprint 1 Review Jan 24, 2023
- Upon revewing Sprint 1 we, as a team, agreed that the first Sprint went well for everybody. Our improvements for the next sprint would be better organization according to scrum structures.

## Sprint 2 Review Feb 13, 2023
- Upon reviewing Sprint 2, we were pleased with our better Scrum organization that was our improvement goal for the sprint. We also demoed the changes we had made to each other. For the next sprint, we hope to have made great progress towards our Minimum Viable Product.
