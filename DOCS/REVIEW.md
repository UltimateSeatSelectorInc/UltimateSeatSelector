## Sprint 1 Review Jan 24, 2023
- Upon revewing Sprint 1 we, as a team, agreed that the first Sprint went well for everybody. Our improvements for the next sprint would be better organization according to scrum structures.

## Sprint 2 Review Feb 13, 2023
- Upon reviewing Sprint 2, we were pleased with our better Scrum organization that was our improvement goal for the sprint. We also demoed the changes we had made to each other. For the next sprint, we hope to have made great progress towards our Minimum Viable Product.

## Sprint 3 Review Feb 28th, 2023
- After reviewing what we accomplished in Sprint 3, we were mostly pleased with meeting most of our goals but decided to put the main focus of our next sprint on ensuring that the website got hosted correctly. This was to be our main priority so that we could see the MVP accomplished.

## Sprint 4 Review Mar 14, 2023
- Upon reviewing Sprint 4, we managed to get our production environment working and improved the looks of the front-end. We have a good starting point for Sprint 5 and made massive progress towards the MVP. Ultimately, we were happy with our progress towards meeting our user stories.

## Sprint 5 Review Mar 28, 2023
- Upon reviewing Sprint 5, we made quite a bit of progress. Unfortunately we didn't finish every user story but some of our estimates on the amount of hours other stories would take was off. We still made massive progress and completely finished MVP so we were satisfied with what we accomplished.

## Sprint 6 Review Apr 11, 2023
- Upon reviewing Sprint 6, we made quite a bit of progress. At this point in the project we will be looking to further refine our other features that were otherwise completed but perhaps don't look the best.

## Sprint 7 Review Apr 25, 2023
- Upon reviewing Sprint 7, we didn't make quite as much progress as previous sprints. Although our project is in a good spot, there were relatively minor changes, mostly luxury features. Our team communication also took a hit, which we hope to improve the next sprint.
