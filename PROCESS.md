# Eric's Angels Process
We will each come to the Sprint Planning session 
with ideas for what we want to accomplish that 
sprint. We will then discuss those ideas and come
up with a plan regarding our objectives and
assinging tasks to each person. Ideally, the first
weekend of the sprint we will communicate on our progress
to be ready for the Sprint Review session the following
Tuesday.

## Schedule
Team members will be participating in a Sprint Planning
session on Tuesday, January 24th @ 2:00 P.M.

We will then participate in a Sprint Review session on
Tuesday, January 31st @ 2:00 P.M.
