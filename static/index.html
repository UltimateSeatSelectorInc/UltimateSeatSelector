<p>This site allows for students and instructors to interactively choose a seat in a lecture. Once entering the password you will be moved to the seat selection page.
    Here you will click on a seat, which may be a physical one or you can click the virtual button if that is how you wish to attend. Once you click on a seat you will 
    enter in your preferred name and last name to the text box. Note, only one per seat unless it is the virtual student area. The current password to get into the site is "1234"</p>

<br>Click the Following link to choose a seat:<br/>
